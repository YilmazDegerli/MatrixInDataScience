# MatrixInDataScience
Matrix in Mathematics and Data Science Matrices are commonly used in many areas, such as physics, graphics, risk modeling, and statistics. Getting familiar with matrices and their transformations is relatively easy but crucial to understanding data science concepts

Before diving Data Science, learning the Matrices is quite important. Therefore I made some research in internet and find fabulous sites about this subjects.
I want to share these sites links with you. I hope that you will like these writings, learn from somethings there and increase your knowledge.
