# Matrix in Mathematics and Data Science

Matrices are commonly used in many areas, such as physics, graphics, risk modeling, and statistics.
Getting familiar with matrices and their transformations is relatively easy but crucial to understanding data science concepts, including linear regression.

Vector and matrices play a central role in data science: they are probably the most common way of representing data to be analyzed
and manipulated by virtually any machine learning or analytics algorithm. However, it is also important to understand that
there really two uses to matrices within data science:
1.	Matrices are the “obvious” way to store tabular data (particularly when all the data is numeric) in an efficient manner.
2.	Matrices are the foundation of linear algebra, which the “language” of most machine learning and analytics algorithms.

Before diving Data Science, learning the Matrices is quite important. Therefore I made some research in internet and find fabulous sites about this subjects.
I want to share these sites links with you. I hope that you will like these writings, learn from somethings there and increase your knowledge.
